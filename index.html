            <p>“Before using scheduling software, we had been losing customers and money due to unfilled shifts and unhappy employees. When we implemented PlanIt, our employees could work when it fit their schedule and we could bring more talent onboard to fill the hours. It drastically impacted the quality of our everyday culture, which has had a serious influence on the satisfaction of our customers.”</p>
